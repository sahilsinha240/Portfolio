#### **Shiba Inu Coin Price Prediction with Machine Learning**

Shiba Inu Coin is the reason for the recent drop in bitcoin prices. The price of  Shiba Inu coin is currently very cheap compared to bitcoin, but some financial experts, claiming that we will see a rise in the price of Shiba Inu Coin soon. In this project, I will walk you through the task of Shiba Inu Price Prediction with Machine Learning using Python.

###### Shiba Inu Price Prediction

Predicting the price of a cryptocurrency is a regression problem in machine learning. Bitcoin is one of the most successful examples of cryptocurrency, but we recently saw a major drop in bitcoin prices due to shiba inu. Unlike bitcoin, shiba Inu coin is very cheap right now, but financial experts are predicting that we may see a major increase in shiba inu prices.

There are many machine learning approaches that we can use for the task of Shiba Inu price prediction. You can train a machine learning model or you can also use an already available powerful model like the Facebook Prophet Model. But in the section below, I will be using the autots library in Python for the task of Shiba Inu coin price prediction with machine learning.

###### Shiba Inu Price Prediction using Python

To predict future Shiba Inu coin prices, you first need to get a dataset for this task. So the dataset for the Shiba Inu coin price are [here](https://github.com/sahilsinha240/CryptoCurrency-Price-Prediction/blob/main/SHIB-USD.csv)

Now let’s get started with the task of Shiba Inu coin price prediction by importing the necessary Python libraries and the dataset.

###### Import Important Libraries

###### Data Collection

###### Data Pre-processing

In this dataset, the “close” column contains the values whose future values that we want to predict, so let’s have a closer look at the historical values of close prices of Shiba Inu coin

###### Feature Selection

Now I will be using the autots library in Python to train a machine learning model for predicting the future prices of Shiba Inu coin. If you have never used this library before then you can easily install it in your system by using the pip command

###### pip install autots

Now let’s train the Shiba Inu coin price prediction model and have a look at the future prices of Shiba Inu coin

###### Training a machine learning model

###### Summary

There are many machine learning approaches that we can use for the task of predicting the future prices of Shiba Inu coin. In this project, I introduced you to how you can predict the future prices of Shiba Inu coin by using the autots library in Python. I hope you like on how to predict the future prices of  Shiba Inu coin with Machine Learning using Python.
