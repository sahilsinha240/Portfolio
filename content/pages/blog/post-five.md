#### Introduction

Air pollution is a growing problem in India, with many of its cities experiencing high levels of pollutants in the atmosphere. This poses significant health risks to the population, ranging from respiratory problems to premature death. To address this critical issue, the Indian government has implemented air quality standards and indexes to monitor and regulate the levels of pollutants in the air.

#### Project Description

In this project, we aim to leverage machine learning algorithms and regression models to analyze and predict the air quality index of major cities in India. We will collect historical data on pollution levels from various sources and use it to train our models. By analyzing this data, we hope to gain insights into the key drivers of air pollution in these cities and develop effective strategies to mitigate pollution levels.

#### Our project will involve the following steps

##### Data collection

We will collect data on air pollution levels, weather conditions, and other relevant factors for major cities in India.

##### Data preprocessing

We will clean and preprocess the collected data to prepare it for analysis.

##### Exploratory data analysis

We will perform exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the trends and patterns of air pollution in these cities.

##### Model selection and training

We will select appropriate machine learning algorithms and regression models to train on our data.

##### Model evaluation and validation

We will evaluate the performance of our models using various metrics such as mean absolute error and root mean squared error.

##### Deployment

We will deploy our trained models to predict air quality index in real-time for major cities in India.

#### Conclusion

The project has the potential to contribute to the development of more effective policies and initiatives to improve air quality and protect the health of the population in India. By leveraging machine learning algorithms and regression models, we hope to provide valuable insights into the key drivers of air pollution and develop effective strategies to mitigate pollution levels.
