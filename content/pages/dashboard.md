        subtitle: ''
        text: >+
          In this powerbi dashboard I have created, a total space mission is
          considered by different space companies from 1960 to 2020, including
          the number of successful launches, the cost of each mission, and the
          types of spacecraft used. Additionally, it also includes information
          on the countries and private companies that have contributed to the
          space industry during this time period. This allows for a
          comprehensive analysis of the evolution of space exploration over the
          past 60 years.

          I used Powerbi dashboard to analyze the company's HR details and also
          to learn more about its features. I found YouTube to be a great
          resource to understand the workings of Powerbi and successfully
          implemented it for the HR Analysis. This analysis enabled us to gain
          valuable insights from the data and make informed decisions that have
          helped in improving our business operations.

          By using Powerbi, I conducted an in-depth analysis of Chicago Crime
          from 2012 to 2017 based on the Kaggle datasets. This dashboard
          provides a comprehensive overview of the crime rate in Chicago over
          the past 5 years. Furthermore, this dashboard also allows for detailed
          comparisons between the various types of crimes and how they have
          evolved over time. The data visualization provides invaluable insights
          that can be used to identify key areas where further action is needed.

          With the Powerbi dashboard, I was able to successfully complete the

          enrollee registration information, which I was able to organize and
          visualize in an easy to understand manner. This process of sorting and
          displaying the data made it simpler for viewers to get a better
          understanding of the results.

          This assignment was a great learning opportunity as I used Powerbi to
          visualize the Jobaaj dataset and create a detailed Walmart dashboard.
          It was quite challenging yet rewarding to be able to see all the
          insights and patterns that the data revealed when visualized. I also
          got an opportunity to learn about Powerbi better in my live classes,
          which increased my confidence in using this software for future
          projects. This assignment has definitely helped me gain a better
          understanding of data visualization and how it is important for making
          business decisions.

          This Powerbi dashboard project was a great example of data
          visualization. I have formulated predictions on the August 2022 prices
          of Shiba INU coin, which is a Crypto currency. It was based on the
          Kaggle dataset, and I believe this would help investors in gauging the
          price movements of the Crypto currency. This project will help
          investors to strategize their investments in the Crypto currency and
          plan for a profitable future.
